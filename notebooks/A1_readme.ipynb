    "# Zipline Data Scientist Take Home Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipline operates the world’s only drone delivery system at national scale to send urgent medicines like blood transfusions and vaccines to those in need – no matter where they live. We’re at the forefront of a logistics revolution, designing, manufacturing, and operating our own battery powered autonomous aircraft fleet to overcome the challenges of delivering just-in-time, lifesaving medical supplies around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our distribution center in Muhanga, we serve rural hospitals in the western half of Rwanda, delivering blood transfusions used to treat conditions like malaria anemia and postpartum hemorrhaging. After an order is placed, an electromechanically actuated launcher accelerates one of our aircraft — known internally as a \"Zip\" — at 5 g's from 0 to 30 m/s (67 mph) in less than a second. From there, the plane autonomously navigates a pre-defined route to the delivery site, drops its package, and returns to the distribution center to recover. For an example of what this looks like, here's a [video from CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeSCEalMOL8).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Zip is made up of three components — a battery, wing, and body. For each flight, a flight operator selects one of each component, \"asembling\" the Zip immediately prior to flight, as our fulfillment operators prepare the package before it's placed in the assembled Zip.\n",

    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this directory, you'll find:\n",
    "- This readme\n",
    "- A `flight_XXXXX.csv` file for each flight in the dataset. Each file contains the following signals from 5 seconds prior to launch, to 15 seconds after launch, logged at approximately 50Hz:\n",

    "## The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visualize the launches in an informative way, and write a few words describing your work and what you found.\n",
    "1. BONUS: Identify any \"outlier\" launches that an engineer should look over, and why.\n",
    "1. DOUBLE BONUS: Identify any interesting patterns in the data, e.g. weather seasonality, poorly performing parts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed the project, please attach any code, figures, and other documents to an email sent to matt@flyzipline.com. Bonus points for code that runs, interactive visualizations, and Jupyter notebooks!"
